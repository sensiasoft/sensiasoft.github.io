       <h2>Technologies</h2>
       <p>
	<em><strong>OGC Standards</strong></em></p>
<p>
	We maintain expertise on many standards published by the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/" target="_blank">Open Geospatial Consortium</a> (<span><span>OGC</span></span>).
 Our center of interest is mainly on the Sensor Web Enablement standards
 (see below) but we also follow closely many other OGC working groups 
working on web services and encodings: Among the most important are the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms" target="_blank">Web Map service</a> (WMS), an interface for access to imagery and map data for visualization, the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs" target="_blank">Web Coverage Service</a> (WCS) for accessing N-dimensional multi-band datasets and the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs" target="_blank">Web Feature Service</a>
 (WFS), a well-known interface for publishing vector data in an 
interoperable manner. We also maintain up to date knowledge on many data
 formats or encoding standardized by the OGC such as , the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml" target="_blank">Geographic Markup Language</a> (GML), <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml" target="_blank">KML</a>,
 GeoJSON and more. We have extensive experience with conformance to 
these standards and have implemented using various technologies and 
programming languages.</p>
<p>
	<em><strong>Sensor Web Enablement</strong></em></p>
<p>
	Our sensor experts are involved in the design and implementation of 
several OGC standards of the Sensor Web Enablement suite of 
specifications. The <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/swecommon" target="_blank"><span>SWE</span> Common Data Model</a> (<span>SWE</span> Common) and the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sensorml" target="_blank">Sensor Modeling Language</a>
 (SensorML) allow the complete description of measurement systems and 
their components. The SensorML language takes a processing approach of 
measurement and lead to unambiguous descriptions of systems that can be 
understood by both humans and machines. Along with the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/om" target="_blank">Observations &amp; Measurements</a>
 (O&amp;M) standard that describes the observations themselves, it can 
describe the full chain of measurement from the data collection to the 
final data delivery. This can be accomplished in an <span>interoperable</span> way so that multiple vendors can build software and infrastructures concurrently while maintaining compatibility. The <span>SensorML</span> language was first developed at the University of Alabama in Huntsville by the VAST Research team where our founder M. <span>Alexandre</span>
 Robin was heavily involved in its design and the development of various
 tools and processing software built around the standard. We are also 
involved in the development of SWE service standards such as the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sos" target="_blank">Sensor Observation Service</a> (SOS) that is an simple efficient service for accessing streaming sensor data, the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sps" target="_blank">Sensor Planning Service</a> (SPS) for tasking sensor or processing devices, and other services for issuing alerts and notifications.</p>
<p>
	<strong><em>Web 2.0</em></strong></p>
<p>
	We provide consulting and development services to help you design 
dynamic websites that provide easy and interactive ways to manipulate 
complex datasets and powerful algorithms.&nbsp;The design of these rich 
content websites benefit from the latest in web technologies to improve 
user experience and simplify access to more complex web services. Thanks
 to recent improvements to well established technologies such as 
Javascript and DHTML, powerful applications can now be developed to take
 full advantage of new browsers capabilities. These applications running
 on the client side can be used to present domain specific data in an 
interactive and user friendly way without sacrificing efficiency or 
losing important information.&nbsp;When even more functionality is 
needed, this new type of web interfaces can also be supported by 
server-side applications to handle things such as right management or 
context dependent behaviors. A wide range of users, going from general 
public to domain experts can then connect and start to use information 
from a service.&nbsp;Sensia Software is innovating by using these new 
technologies to connect to your sensor networks and other data sources. 
We have experience with the following technologies: 
HTML5,&nbsp;Javascript/JSON, XML messaging and AJAX,&nbsp;XML Stylesheet
 Transformation (XSLT),&nbsp;Multi-Browser support, and more.</p>
<p>
	<em><strong>Mobile Devices and </strong></em><strong><em>Cloud Computing</em></strong></p>
<p>
	We also have experience in software development for mobile devices 
based on Android or Apple OSes, as well as expertise in the different 
cloud computing platforms available. We have built advanced web 
applications deployed on Amazon EC2 and Google App Engine.</p>
